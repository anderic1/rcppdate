Description: 'date' is a C++ header library offering extensive date
 and time functionality for the C++11, C++14 and C++17 standards
 written by Howard Hinnant and released under the MIT license. A
 slighly modified version has been accepted (along with 'tz.h') as
 part of C++20. This package regroups all header files from the
 upstream repository by Howard Hinnant so that other R packages can
 use them in their C++ code. At present, few of the types have
 explicit Rcpp wrapper though these may be added as needed.
