### About

The [date](https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date) library by Howard Hinnant
offers extensive date and time functionality for the C++11, C++14 and 
C++17 standards.  A slighly modified version has been accepted (along with
'tz.h') as part of C++20. 

This package regroups all header files from the upstream repository by Howard
